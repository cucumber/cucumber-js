# 2021-07-17

This retrospective was from the first [new contributors mob/ensemble]. Sadly [@mattwynne] failed to record the stream, so there's no video from this session.

## Who

* [@artismarti]
* [@16sheep]
* [@eoola]
* [@mattwynne] (taking these notes)

## What happened?

* We read the issues at https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/contribute
* We decided to tackle one
* We discussed how contributing to the repo worked
* We changed what to tackle and tackled something simpler
* We made a [PR](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/pull/1734).

## What worked? What do you appreciate?

* I learned general concepts that I could use in other open source projects
* The issues were good for first timers. I'm keen to explore more now I've looked through them!
* It was so much fun! All the intimidation I had about starting to do this vanished. Low stakes way of learning new things. A nice way of learning new stuff!
* The team gelled almost instantly

## What was puzzling or frustrating?

* Why did the tests pass on your device but not mine?
* Live Share vs Screen Share it was a bit confusing
* Would it be easier to just run it locally on one of our machines? More realistic.
* Twitch setup (Matt heard his own voice the whole way through, and we started late)

## What should we decide / change for next time?

* Do this regularly but on any codebase, not just Cucumber
* Would it be easier to just run it locally on one of our machines?
* Matt do more homeowrk on twitch setup
* Let's do this again!
* Update CONTRIBUTING.md guide to include pointers to basics about forking, how to name your branch etc., and some words of comfort and encouragement to make mistakes, ask for help etc.
