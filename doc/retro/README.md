# Retrospective notes

From time to time, we run a mobbing/ensemble session on this codebase. At the end of each session., we 
run a brief [retrospective] conversation in an effort to "turn up the good" â€“ Woody Zuill.

Each retro we run is recorded in this folder as a dated Markdown file.

e.g. To find the retrospective for 23rd May 2020 you would look in the file `2020/05/23.md`
