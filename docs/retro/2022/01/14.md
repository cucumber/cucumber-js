# What we liked:

* small pieces / small steps
* screensharing - made it easy to switch over, like when Demi left
* liked talking about cars! - personal connection is really important.
* liked the explanation of the World. Hugely valuable for Blaise! Cucumber ecosystem struggles defining these concepts for newcomers.
* A clear objective with many similar, small examples of it. Easy to shift context from one problem to the next, even though they were all slightly different.
* we just kept rolling when Blaise arrived and Demi left.
* Kate coming along even though she didn't feel she had a lot to contribute

# Anything we would do differently? Puzzles?

* Took half an hour to get started - setting up the environment, etc. A script to get everything set up beforehand? GitPod? 15 minutes was just spent chatting but we value that!
* Deciding what to work on took some time too - could we do that in Slack beforehand?
* We could log how time is spent. Blaise has acted as "the scribe" beforehand.
* VS Code linting was broken on Matt's machine at least.
* Matt's GPG keychain
* Tests run slowly

# Actions

* Kate: be the scribe next week, and spot how we spend our time
* Matt: Fix GPG key and linting thing
* Blaise: Come along next week!
