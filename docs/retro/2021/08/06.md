# 2021-08-06

This session was streamed live and recorded. Watch the video [here](https://youtu.be/EiqLzBBpjxM).

## Who

* [@artismarti]
* [@16sheep]
* [@mattwynne] (taking these notes)

## What happened

* Discussed what to do.
* Worked from Marju's fork, using our own local machines and VSCode each time we switched driver.
* Re-did the work we did last time on the mobbing machine, using Marju's machine to submit a new PR ([#1764]) cleanly. We learned about `git cherry-pick`.
* Started working through the pre-prepared issue [#1136] in a [branch on Marju's fork](https://github.com/16sheep/cucumber-js/tree/opt-out-print-attachments-1136)
* Arti had to leave a bit early

## Insights

* Preferred working on own machine, not using the live share / mobbing machine.
* Good to prepare. But, wonder if you over-prepare, it doesn't leave space for people to explore and learn.
* Good to have an issue to focus on, and perhaps a failing test (but we could also write this ourselves).
  * It would help to share what we're goin g to work on beforehand so people watching can also know ahead of time. Decide now for next session?
* Matt didn't like being in charge of the timer.
  * Could use different mechanism for changing turns, like when we make a commit, or when a test is passing?
* More people would be nice. Should we make it easier for people to join? How? How often can we run it?

### Actions / decisions

* Next time, continue with fixing [#1136]
