# Parallel

Cucumber supports running scenarios in parallel. The main process becomes a "coordinator" and spins up several separate Node.js processes to be the "workers". You can enable this with the `parallel` configuration option:

- In a configuration file `{ parallel: 3 }`
- On the CLI `$ cucumber-js --parallel 3`

The number you provide is the number of workers that will run scenarios in parallel.

Each worker receives the following env variables (as well as a copy of `process.env` from the coordinator process):

* `CUCUMBER_PARALLEL` - set to 'true'
* `CUCUMBER_TOTAL_WORKERS` - set to the number of workers
* `CUCUMBER_WORKER_ID` - ID for worker ('0', '1', '2', etc.)

### Timing

When using parallel mode, the last line of the summary output differentiates between real time elapsed during the test run and aggregate time spent actually running steps:

```
73 scenarios (73 passed)
512 steps (512 passed)
0m51.627s (executing steps: 4m51.228s)
```

### Hooks

When using parallel mode, any `BeforeAll` and `AfterAll` hooks you have defined will run _once per worker_.

### Custom work assignment

If you would like to prevent specific sets of scenarios from running in parallel you can use `setParallelCanAssign`.

Example:
```javascript
setParallelCanAssign(function(pickleInQuestion, picklesInProgress) {
  // Only one pickle with the word example in the name can run at a time
  if (pickleInQuestion.name.includes("example")) {
    return picklesInProgress.every(p => !p.name.includes("example"));
  }
  // No other restrictions
  return true;
})
```

For convenience, the following helpers exist to build a `canAssignFn`:

```javascript
import { setParallelCanAssign, parallelCanAssignHelpers } from '@cucumber/cucumber'

const { atMostOnePicklePerTag } = parallelCanAssignHelpers
const myTagRule = atMostOnePicklePerTag(["@tag1", "@tag2"]);

// Only one pickle with @tag1 can run at a time
//   AND only one pickle with @tag2 can run at a time
setParallelCanAssign(myTagRule)

// If you want to join a tag rule with other rules you can compose them like so:
const myCustomRule = function(pickleInQuestion, picklesInProgress) {
  // ...
};

setParallelCanAssign(function(pickleInQuestion, picklesInProgress) {
  return myCustomRule(pickleInQuestion, picklesInProgress) &&
    myTagRule(pickleInQuestion, picklesInProgress);
})
```
