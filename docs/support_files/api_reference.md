## API Reference

Each method can be destructured from the object returned by `require('cucumber')`.

---

#### `defineParameterType({name, preferForRegexpMatch, regexp, transformer, useForSnippets})`

Define a new parameter type and optionally convert an output parameter into something else.

* `name`: string used to refer to this type in cucumber expressions
* `regexp`: A regular expression (or array of regular expressions) that match the parameter
* `transformer`: An optional function which transforms the captured argument from a string into what is passed to the step definition.
  If no transform function is specified, the captured argument is left as a string.
  The function can be synchronous or return a `Promise` of the transformed value. The value of `this` is the current world, so the function can delegate to world functions. World delegation does not work with arrow functions.
* `useForSnippets`: Defaults to `true`. That means this parameter type will be used to generate snippets for undefined steps. If the `regexp` frequently matches text you don't intend to be used as arguments, disable its use for snippets with `false`.
* `preferForRegexpMatch`: Defaults to `false`. Set to true if you use regular expressions and you want this parameter type's `regexp` to take precedence over others during a match.

The built in parameter types are
* `int`
* `float`
* `string`
  * contained in single or double quotes
  * the transformer removes the quotes
* `word`

#### `After([options,] fn)`

Defines a hook which is run after each scenario.

* `options`: An object with the following keys:
  * `tags`: string tag expression used to apply this hook to only specific scenarios. See [cucumber-tag-expressions](https://docs.cucumber.io/tag-expressions/) for more information
  * `timeout`: A hook-specific timeout, to override the default timeout.
* `fn`: A function, defined as follows:
  * The first argument will be an object of the form `{sourceLocation: {line, uri}, result: {duration, status}, pickle}`
    * The pickle object comes from the [gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/tree/gherkin-v4.1.3/gherkin) library. See `testdata/good/*.pickles.ndjson` for examples of its structure.
  * When using the asynchronous callback interface, have one final argument for the callback function.

`options` can also be a string as a shorthand for specifying `tags`.

Multiple `After` hooks are executed in the **reverse** order that they are defined.

---

#### `AfterAll([options,] fn)`

Defines a hook which is run after all scenarios have completed.

* `options`: An object with the following keys:
  * `timeout`: A hook-specific timeout, to override the default timeout.
* `fn`: A function, defined as follows:
  * When using the asynchronous callback interface, have one argument for the callback function.

Multiple `AfterAll` hooks are executed in the **reverse** order that they are defined.

---

#### `Before([options,] fn)`

Defines a hook which is run before each scenario. Same interface as `After` except the first argument passed to `fn` will not have the `result` property.

Multiple `Before` hooks are executed in the order that they are defined.

---

#### `BeforeAll([options,] fn)`

Defines a hook which is run before all scenarios. Same interface as `AfterAll`.

Multiple `BeforeAll` hooks are executed in the order that they are defined.

---

#### `defineStep(pattern[, options], fn)`

Defines a step.

* `pattern`: A regex or string pattern to match against a gherkin step.
* `options`: An object with the following keys:
  - `timeout`: A step-specific timeout, to override the default timeout.
  - `wrapperOptions`: step-specific options that are passed to the definition function wrapper.
  - `phase`: A string equal to `'given'`, `'when'`, `'then'`, or `undefined`.
* `fn`: A function, which should be defined as follows:
  - Should have one argument for each capture in the regular expression.
  - May have an additional argument if the gherkin step has a docstring or data table.
  - When using the asynchronous callback interface, have one final argument for the callback function.

---

#### `Given(pattern[, options], fn)`

Defines a step with `options.phase` set to `'given'`.

---

#### `setDefaultTimeout(milliseconds)`

Set the default timeout for asynchronous steps. Defaults to `5000` milliseconds.

---

#### `setDefinitionFunctionWrapper(fn, options)`

Set a function used to wrap step / hook definitions. When used, the result is wrapped again to ensure it has the same length of the original step / hook definition. `options` is the step specific `wrapperOptions` and may be undefined.

---

#### `setWorldConstructor(constructor)`

Set a custom world constructor, to override the default world constructor:

```javascript
function World({attach, parameters}) {
  this.attach = attach
  this.parameters = parameters
}
```

* `attach` - a function hooks / steps can use to add [attachments](./attachments.md)
* `parameters` - world parameters passed in through the [cli](../cli.md#world-parameters)

**Note:** The World constructor was made strictly synchronous in *[v0.8.0](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/releases/tag/v0.8.0)*.

---

#### `Then(pattern[, options], fn)`

Defines a step with `options.phase` set to `'then'`.

---

#### `When(pattern[, options], fn)`

Defines a step with `options.phase` set to `'when'`.
