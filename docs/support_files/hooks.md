# Hooks

Hooks are used for setup and teardown the environment before and after each scenario. See the [API reference](./api_reference.md) for the specification of the first argument passed to hooks. Multiple *Before* hooks are executed in the order that they were defined. Multiple *After* hooks are executed in the **reverse** order that they were defined.

```javascript
var {After, Before} = require('cucumber');

// Synchronous
Before(function () {
  this.count = 0;
});

// Asynchronous Callback
Before(function (testCase, callback) {
  var world = this;
  tmp.dir({unsafeCleanup: true}, function(error, dir) {
    if (error) {
      callback(error);
    } else {
      world.tmpDir = dir;
      callback();
    }
  });
});

// Asynchronous Promise
After(function () {
  // Assuming this.driver is a selenium webdriver
  return this.driver.quit();
});
```

## Tagged hooks

Hooks can be conditionally selected for execution based on the tags of the scenario.

```javascript
var {After, Before} = require('cucumber');

Before(function () {
  // This hook will be executed before all scenarios
});

Before({tags: "@foo"}, function () {
  // This hook will be executed before scenarios tagged with @foo
});

Before({tags: "@foo and @bar"}, function () {
  // This hook will be executed before scenarios tagged with @foo and @bar
});

Before({tags: "@foo or @bar"}, function () {
  // This hook will be executed before scenarios tagged with @foo or @bar
});

// You can use the following shorthand when only specifying tags
Before("@foo", function () {
  // This hook will be executed before scenarios tagged with @foo
});
```

See more documentation on [tag expressions](https://docs.cucumber.io/cucumber/api/#tag-expressions)

## Skipping in a Before Hook

If you need to imperatively skip a test using a `Before` hook, this can be done using any of the constructs defined in [skipped steps](./step_definitions.md)

This includes using: a synchronous return, an asynchronous callback, or an asynchronous promise

```javascript
// Synchronous
Before(function() {
  // perform some runtime check to decide whether to skip the proceeding scenario
  return 'skipped'
});
```

## BeforeAll / AfterAll

If you have some setup / teardown that needs to be done before or after all scenarios, use `BeforeAll` / `AfterAll`. Like hooks and steps, these can be synchronous, accept a callback, or return a promise.

Unlike `Before` / `After` these methods will not have a world instance as `this`. This is because each scenario gets its own world instance and these hooks run before / after **all** scenarios.

```javascript
var {AfterAll, BeforeAll} = require('cucumber');

// Synchronous
BeforeAll(function () {
  // perform some shared setup
});

// Asynchronous Callback
BeforeAll(function (callback) {
  // perform some shared setup

  // execute the callback (optionally passing an error when done)
});

// Asynchronous Promise
AfterAll(function () {
  // perform some shared teardown
  return Promise.resolve()
});
```

# BeforeStep / AfterStep

If you have some execution that needs to be done before or after all step, use `BeforeStep` / `AfterStep` hooks. Like the `Before` / `After` hooks, these also have a world instance as 'this', and can be conditionally selected for execution based on the tags of the scenario..

```javascript
var {AfterStep, BeforeStep} = require('cucumber');

BeforeStep(function () {
  // This hook will be executed before all steps
});

AfterStep({tags: "@foo"}, function () {
  // This hook will be executed before every step in a scenario tagged with @foo
});
```
