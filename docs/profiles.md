# Profiles

If you have several permutations of running Cucumber with different options in your project, it might be a bit cumbersome to manage. *Profiles* enable you to declare bundles of configuration and reference them with a single CLI option. You can use multiple profiles at once and you can still supply options directly on the CLI when using profiles.

Profiles are invoked from the command line using the `--profile` CLI option.

```shell
$ cucumber-js --profile my_profile
```

The short tag is `-p`

```shell
$ cucumber-js -p my_profile
```

## Simple Example

Let's take the common case of having some things a bit different locally than on a continuous integration server. Here's the configuration we've been running locally:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  default: {
    format: ['progress-bar', 'html:cucumber-report.html'],
    requireModule: ['ts-node/register'],
    require: ['support/**/*.ts'],
    worldParameters: {
      appUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/'
    }
  }
}
```

For argument's sake, we'll want these changes in CI:

- The URL for the app (maybe dynamically provisioned?)
- The formatters we want to use
- Publish a report

Adding profiles is a matter of exporting more named slices of configuration from our file. We can lean on JavaScript to reduce duplication and grab things dynamically as needed. Here's what we might write to address the needs described above:

```javascript
const common = {
  requireModule: ['ts-node/register'],
  require: ['support/**/*.ts'],
  worldParameters: {
    appUrl: process.env.MY_APP_URL || 'http://localhost:3000/'
  }
}

module.exports = {
  default: {
    ...common,
    format: ['progress-bar', 'html:cucumber-report.html'],
  },
  ci: {
    ...common,
    format: ['html:cucumber-report.html'],
    publish: true
  }
}
```

Now, if we just run `cucumber-js` with no arguments, it will pick up our profiles and use the `default` one.  To run the CI profile we will use this command:

```shell
$ cucumber-js -p ci
```

## Using Profiles for Arguments

Cucumber doesn't allow custom command line arguments. For example:

```shell
$ cucumber-js --myArgument
```

The above will result in `error: unknown option '--myArgument'`.

At first glance this can create problems for test suites that need configuration on the fly, particularly web page test suites that need to run the exact same tests against different browser engines and viewport sizes. However, profiles can be used to work around this problem.

The intended method for passing arguments to tests is the `worldParameters` configuration option, discussed in detail in the section on the [World](./support_files/world.md) object. As this argument expects a JSON literal it can be very tedious to use directly. However, we can use a profile as an alias for each of these options.

Consider the following profile configuration file:

```javascript 
module.exports = {
  desktop: `--world-parameters '{"device": {"type":"desktop","height":720,"width":1280}}'`,
  phone: `--world-parameters '{"device": {"type":"phone","height":568,"width":320}}'`,
  tablet: `--world-parameters '{"device": {"type":"tablet","height":1024,"width":768}}'`,
  chromium: `--world-parameters '{"browser": "chromium"}'`,
  firefox: `--world-parameters '{"browser": "firefox"}'`,
  webkit: `--world-parameters '{"browser": "webkit"}'`
}
```
With it in place we can invoke a test of the iPhone with this command:

```shell
$ cucumber-js -p webkit -p phone
```

The world parameter arguments from the two profile calls will be merged. If you pass profiles that try to set the same parameter, the last one passed in the chain will win out.

## Summary
- Profiles are used to group common cli arguments together for easy reuse.
- They can also be used to create world-parameter options rather than trying to use a JSON literal on the command line.
- The `--profile` or `-p` CLI option is repeatable, so you can apply multiple profiles at once.
- You can still supply options directly on the command line when using profiles, they will be appended to whatever comes from profiles.
