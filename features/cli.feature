Feature: Command line interface
  In order to run cucumber in different contexts
  As a person who wants to run features
  I want to run Cucumber on the command line

  Scenario: run a single feature

      You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

      this.When(/^a step is undefined$/, function (callback) {
        // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
        callback.pending();
