Feature: Command line interface
  In order to run cucumber in different contexts
  As a person who wants to run features
  I want to run Cucumber on the command line

  Scenario: run feature with non-default step definitions file location specified (-r option)
    Given a file named "features/a.feature" with:
      """
      Feature: some feature
        Scenario:
          When a step is passing
      """
    And a file named "step_definitions/cucumber_steps.js" with:
      """
      const {When} = require('@cucumber/cucumber')

      When(/^a step is passing$/, function() {})
      """
    When I run cucumber-js with `-r step_definitions/cucumber_steps.js`

  Scenario: run feature with step definitions in required directory (-r option)
    Given a file named "features/a.feature" with:
      """
      Feature: some feature
        Scenario:
          When a step is passing
      """
    And a file named "step_definitions/cucumber_steps.js" with:
      """
      const {When} = require('@cucumber/cucumber')

      When(/^a step is passing$/, function() {});
      """
    When I run cucumber-js with `-r step_definitions`

  @spawn
  Scenario: display Cucumber version
    When I run cucumber-js with `--version`
    Then I see the version of Cucumber

  @spawn
  Scenario: display help
    When I run cucumber-js with `--help`
    Then I see the help text for Cucumber
