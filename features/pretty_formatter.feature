Feature: Pretty Formatter
  In order to visualize the tests in an a set of Cucumber features
  Developers should be able to see prettified view of the scenarios that are being executed

  Scenario: Output pretty text for a feature with no scenarios
    Given a file named "features/a.feature" with:
      """
      Feature: some feature
      """
    When I run cucumber.js with `-f pretty`
    Then it outputs this text:
      """
      Feature: some feature



      0 scenarios
      0 steps
      """

  Scenario: Pretty formatter hides around, before and after hooks
    Given a file named "features/a.feature" with:
      """
      Feature: some feature
