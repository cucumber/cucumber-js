Feature: Target specific scenarios
  As a developer running features
  I want an easy way to run specific scenarios by tag
  So that I don't waste time running my whole test suite when I don't need to

  Background:
    Given a file named "features/a.feature" with:
      """
      Feature: some feature
        @a
        Scenario: first scenario
          When a step is passing

        @b
        Scenario Outline: second scenario
          When a step is <STATUS>

          @c
          Examples:
            | STATUS  |
            | passing |
            | pending |

          @d
          Examples:
            | STATUS    |
            | undefined |
