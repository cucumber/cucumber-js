## Thank you!

Before anything else, thank you. Thank you for taking some of your precious time helping this project move forward.

This guide will help you get started with Cucumber.js's development environment. You'll also find the set of rules you're expected to follow in order to submit improvements and fixes to Cucumber.js.

## Tests

There are two set of tests resulting from the BDD approach we've been applying to Cucumber.js from the beginning.

* full-stack tests (outside): surprisingly those are Gherkin scenarios;
* unit tests (inside): jasmine specs.

### Specs

Run the specs:

    $ npm i && npm test

### Debug messages

You can display debug messages by setting the DEBUG_LEVEL environment variable. It goes from `1` to `5`. `5` will display everything, `1` will only print out the critical things.

    $ DEBUG_LEVEL=5 ./bin/cucumber.js


## Coding guidelines

If you plan on submitting code, read this carefully. Please note it is not yet complete.

We stick to the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml).

In addition to those syntactic rules, we apply the following principles:

### Write expressive method and function names

Use expressive names. Express arguments as part of the method/function name. Someone calling it should be able to infer the expected arguments only from the name. They shouldn't have to check the method/function definition.

``` javascript
adorn(/* ... */) // BAD: it does not tell anything about its
                 // parameters, you'll need to read the method
                 // definition to know the arguments.

addStyleToText(/* ... */) // you can fairly guess this function
                          // accepts "style" and "text" arguments:
```

** WORK IN PROGRESS **

## Release process

_The following is a checklist for maintainers when preparing a new release_

Perform the following steps on a feature branch.

* Update `CHANGELOG.md`
  * Describe the major changes introduced. API changes must be documented. In particular, backward-incompatible changes must be well explained, with examples when possible.
  * `git log --format=format:"* %s (%an)" --reverse <last-version-tag>..HEAD` might be handy.
* Update `package.json`
  * bump version
  * add new contributors, if any
    * `git log --format=format:"%an <%ae>" --reverse <last-version-tag>..HEAD`
* Compile the bundle with `npm run build-release`

Review the changes, if everything looks good, squash merge into master.

* commit message should have the format "Release 0.1.2" (replacing *0.1.2* with the actual version)
* Tag commit as "v0.1.2"
* Publish to NPM
